# GeckoBot
A python script built to scrap latest news from CoinGecko news and post them to a telegram channel without a delay... 

# Pre Requirements

The script won't just start working automatically. Here's some little nuisance before it start working :

- Get your Bot API token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Get your telegram Channel ID using [@chnlidbot](https://t.me/chnlidbot)
- Make that bot admin in your telegram channel with posting right.
- Make some edit inside the code where needed..
- Command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage
Now we are finally able to use that nasty bot.
- Command `python gecko.py` in linux shell.

ðŸ”¥ **Boom !  Enjoy !**
